Method for Determining Audible Tones in Noise\n        The method to determine the presence of pure tones shall be the tonality limits\n        provided in Annex C of ISO/DIS 1996-2 Annex D. As an alternative, the\n        Zwicker method can be used. This method is described in the following\n        sections. As a minimum, the Zwicker method shall be provided for\n        information.\n   (a)  The method is based on the psycho-acoustic concept of critical bands and the\n        objective of the method is to give the same judgement of the prominence of\n        any tones as an average listener.\n   (b)  The method is based on the Zwicker Critical Bands, and is in most details\n        equivalent to ANSI S12.10:1985 (or ANSI S12.10:2002). It consists of three\n        steps:\n", "( i )   Frequency analysis.\n( i i )   Determination of the sound pressure level of the tone(s) and the sound\n        pressure level of the masking noise within a critical band centered at the tone\n        frequency.\n(iii)   The difference between the levels (\u2206Ltn) is compared to a criterion curve, and\n        it is decided whether the tone is \"Prominent\".\n", "                                                                      Section 21, page 21-32\n   (c)       Frequency Analysis\n   (i)       Any kind of narrow band frequency analyzer may be used, but the effective\n             analysis bandwidth (equivalent to the noise bandwidth) shall be less than the\n             values shown in the table below:\nTone Frequency,\n                            20-63     63-200     200-630       630-2k      2k-6.3k    6.3-20k\nHz\nEffective\nanalysis          Abs.      20 Hz     20 Hz      20 Hz         22 Hz       57 Hz      126 Hz\nbandwidth         Rel.      32%       10%        3.5%          2.8%        2%         1.6%\n             (For an FFT analysis, this condition is fulfilled if the actual tones are placed\n             on the upper 2/3 of the frequency range).\n   (ii)      If the tone as well as the noise is stationary, the analysis time should be at\n             least 2 minutes, 200-500 spectra should be averaged. For non-stationary\n             conditions see Clause 5.8.\n   (iii)     In the case of a tone complex with closely spaced tone components, an even\n             finer resolution may be needed to determine the level of the masking noise\n             correctly.\n   (d)       Determination of Sound Pressure Levels\n   (i)       The bandwidth of the critical bands are:\n                                                                      Above\n                   Center Frequency (fc), Hz             20-500\n                                                                      500\n                   Bandwidth                             100 Hz       20% of fc\n   (ii)      The critical band is positioned with centre frequency coincident with the tone\n", "    frequency. If more closely spaced tones are present, the critical band is placed\n    so that it includes the largest possible number of the most prominent tones.\n    The lowest critical band is 20 Hz - 120 Hz.\n(e) Sound Pressure Level of Tone, Lpt\n    The sound pressure level of the tone Lpt is read from the analysis. It may be\n    necessary to correct for the picket-fence effect of digital narrow band\n    analyzers. If more tones are present in the same critical band, their levels are\n    added on energy basis to give the total Lpt.\n", "                                                               Section 21, page 21-33\n(f)   Sound Pressure Level of the Masking Noise within a Critical Band, Lpn\n(i)   The sound pressure level of the noise is determined from the same analysis as\n      if the tones were not present. All peaks resulting from the tones and their\n      possible sidebands are disregarded.\n                                         Critical Bandwidth\n        L pn = L pn,avg + 10 log10\n(ii)  The total   noise level within    a critical\n                                   Effective       band,Bandwidth\n                                               Analysis  Lpn may be found as the average\n      level within the critical band, Lpn,avg, and corrected to the bandwidth of the\n      critical band:\n(iii) Lpn,avg can be determined by visually averaging of the spectrum apart from\n      the tones.\n(iv)  Alternatively, the level may be found by energy summing of all analysis bands\n      within the critical band not due to tones. In this a correction must be made for\n      the effective analysis bandwidth being generally wider than the frequency\n      reduction. With the commonly applied Hanning weighting function, the\n      analysis bandwidth is 1.5 times the resolution.\n                                          2.5\n                                        f\n        \u2206Ltn,crit = 4.5 - log10 [ 1 + (       )]\n(g)   Evaluation                        502\n      The difference between the tone level and the noise level, \u2206Ltn = Lpt - Lpn, is\n      compared to a criterion curve. If \u2206Ltn is below the lower curve, the tone is\n      masked and cannot be detected by average listeners. If \u2206Ltn is above the\n      upper criterion curve, the level of the tone is 6.5 dB above the threshold and is\n      described as \"Prominent\" by average listeners. For rating of noise a +5 dB\n      penalty is then applied. The equation of the criterion curve is:\n", "", "                                                             Section 21, page 21-34\n( h ) Non-Stationary Conditions\n( i ) If the level of the frequency of the tone is varying, the highest level of the tone\n       is found from a frequency analysis using time weighting F. A minimum of 5\n       analyses shall be carried out and the average computed from the average of\n       the highest 5 levels. The level of the masking noise is found by averaging over\n       at least 2 minutes.\n(ii)   It is difficult to approximate time weighting constant F by use of an FFT\n       analyzer. The following method is recommended, being validated for ordinary\n       400-lines FFT analyzers:\n( 1 ) With a full scale frequency of 1 kHz, a single spectrum approximates time\n       weighting F.\n( 2 ) With a full scale frequency of 2 kHz or higher, the exponential average of two\n       spectra approximates to time weighting F. In this connection it must be made\n       sure that the \"real time\" frequency of the analyzer is not exceeded.\n(i)    More Tones in Separate Critical Bands\n", "        If there are several tones (or groups of tones) in different critical bands, each\n        critical band is evaluated separately. The critical band giving cause for the\n        largest \u2206Ltn contains the most dominant tone(s).\n21.8.6.

General Requirements\n   (a)   This Section of PS specifies categories of material, tests and requirements of\n         fire resistance and reaction to fire.\n   (b)   The requirements for the reaction to fire performance of the main material\n         surfaces vary depending on the location and orientation of the material. The\n", "                                                                  Section 21, page 21-40\n         locations are split into interior and exterior. The orientation is described as one\n         of three types.\n         Horizontal Supine (HS)       - orientation as a floor\n         Vertical (V)         - orientation as a wall\n         Horizontal Prone (HP)        - orientation as a ceiling.\n         Some testing is item specific and is referenced and described as such.\n   (c)   The requirements apply to all materials. Where materials are contained in a\n         box, e.g. an equipment case, and the box is sealed and2 constructed from a\n         material which has fire resistance (by inspection or from certification)\n         commensurate with the fire load within the box, then subject to approval, the\n         enclosed materials need not comply.\n   (d)   A category of materials is defined as being minor; i.e. of minor usage. These\n         categories are intended to be used for materials, the amount of which in any\n         particular area, is insufficient to justify its consideration as a surface. As an\n         indication the limiting surface may be taken as 0.01m .\n   (i)   For interior use, items up to 500g may be considered in this category. For\n         exterior use, items up to 2kg may be considered to be in this category.\n   (ii)  For interior use items below 100g do not require testing. For exterior use\n         items below 400g do not require testing.\n   (e)   The right is reserved to require testing and compliance for items below the\n         testing threshold weights if inspection, say, of a materials schedule, indicates\n         that the grouping or density of such items may lead to a hazardous situation\n         developing.\n21.10.5. Fire Resistance Requirements\n   (a)   Floor\n", "(i)  The floor shall achieve 30 minutes endurance rating when tested according to\n     the ASTM E 119 procedure in NFPA 130.\n(ii) The floor sample shall be of a sufficient size to accommodate examples of any\n     floor penetrations used on the vehicle. These shall also achieve the required\n     fire resistance.\n(b)  Equipment Cubicle Interface with Saloon or Cab\n(i)  The saloon or cab face of the interface shall achieve 20 minutes integrity to\n     BS 476 : Parts 20 and 22.\n", "                                                              Section 21, page 21-41\n(ii)    In carrying out the test consideration shall be given to avoiding spurious\n        effects caused as a result of the metallic circumference of the wall/floor of the\n        train expanding within a \"fixed\" ceramic structure, a situation which will not\n        occur in practice.\n(c)     Cavities\n( i )   Any cavity formed in the wall which is not filled to both faces with a non-\n        combustible (classified by a standard called in NFPA 130 or BS 476 : Part 4)\n        insulating material shall be prevented from \"communicating\" with any ceiling\n        cavity by the inclusion of a barrier at the wall cavity/ceiling interface. The\n        function of the barrier is to prevent ready movement of air up towards any\n        ceiling void promoting a \"chimney\" or \"stack\" effect.\n( i i )   If warranted by the Fire Hazard Analysis in 25.5.5.c , Any cavity formed in\n        the ceiling which is not filled to both faces with a non-combustible (classified\n        by a standard called in NFPA 130 or BS 476 : Part 4 ) insulating material shall\n        be compartmented across its width at distances not exceeding 5m by the\n        inclusion of a barrier. The function of the barrier is to prevent ready\n        movement of air through the void which would promote conditions of high\n        heat transfer efficiency.\n(iii)   The barrier shall be prepared from a material which is either by inspection\n        (proven on previous contract), or from certification, capable of achieving 30\n        minutes integrity to BS 476 : Parts 20 and 22. No fire resistance test of the full\n        structure is required.\n( i v ) The interface between the barrier and the interior faces of the cavity shall be\n        protected or bonded in such a way that ready movement of fire products\n        between the barrier and either of the faces is prevented when exposed to fire.\n        Intumescent protection should be considered.\n( v ) The design and materials shall be submitted for approval.\n (d)    Seat Shell (Back & Base)\n", "   (i)   It is required that the material used to form the seat shell (back and base)\n         protects the seat trim from the effects of fire occurring under or around the\n         seat.\n   (ii)  The material shall, therefore, either by inspection (proven on previous\n         contract), or from certification be capable of achieving 10 minutes integrity to\n         BS 476: Parts 20 and 22. No fire resistance test of the full seat is required.\n21.10.6. Reaction to Fire Methods\n", "                                                            Section 21, page 21-42\n(a)   Surfaces\n(i)   Flame Retardancy\n      As an option to the NFPA 130 standards, the methods to be used are BS 476 :\n      Parts 6 and 7. Both shall be used in standard form and the requirements are\n      given in standard form with the exception that certain surfaces are required to\n      be Nil spread for the BS 476 : Part 7 test. This is not a formal categorisation\n      under the standard but the information is available in the full report of the tests.\n(ii)  Smoke Emission\n      As an option to the NFPA 130 standards, the methods used are BS 6853\n      Appendix B5.2, (vertical and horizontal prone) and Appendix B5.4 (horizontal\n      supine). The requirements are given in the standard form using the standard\n      units.\n(iii) Toxic Fume Emission\n( 1 ) The method to be used is NF X 70 100 (if not applicable, replacement of NF X\n      70-100-1 and NF X 70-100-2 is acceptable) or an alternate standard approved\n      by the Engineer. The methodology is as standard but there is a requirement to\n      measure and consider an additional species, nitrogen dioxide (in the form of\n      nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide combined, quoted as nitrogen dioxide).\n( 2 ) The NF X 70-100 standard normally generates toxic fume emission in units of\n      milligrams of species per gram of material combusted. For surfaces this value\n      needs to be converted to a notional value on an area basis using information\n      specific to the application; e.g. the weight per unit area of the material. (If this\n      leads to unrealistically high values for thick materials, this will be considered,\n      in the event of a contravention of the requirements occurring, on a case by case\n      basis where an effective depth of surface will be defined by the Engineer).\n( 3 ) For the NF X 70-100 method, the results for all the gases measured, with the\n      addition of nitrogen dioxide, should be expressed as grams of toxin per m2 of\n      surface. The value generated for each toxin is weighted for relative effect by\n      dividing by the reference values also in gm 2.\n", "( 4 ) The resulting ratios shall be summed to give the weighted summation ratio,\n      \"R\". This ratio is allowed to vary reflecting changes in location and amount of\n      material destroyed.\n(b)   Cables\n", "                                                           Section 21, page 21-43\n(i)   General Requirements\n( 1 ) Minimum quantity of inflammable material shall be used in the construction of\n      all cables which shall minimise the production of smoke and toxic fumes in\n      the event of fire or short circuit.\n( 2 ) All cables shall have high resistance to fire propagation.

Use a content domain matrix to select content for questions.\n3 . Focus the question on a single idea or task derived from a validated resource book\n     or job analysis where available.\n4 . Keep the question job-related and linked to a practical job competency possibly\n     through creating a real-life scenario or situation in the stem of the question.\n5 . Keep items independent. It should not be necessary to know the answer to one item\n     to answer another; one item should not provide a clue to another.\nLevel of Difficulty\n6.   Eliminate irrelevant difficulty by:\n       \u2022 Using simple, familiar language\n       \u2022 Using the positive rather than the negative in the stem\n       \u2022 Using technical language or jargon only if it is the target of the question\n       \u2022 Keeping the reading level of the item at least two grade levels below the\n           formal education level of the test taker\n       \u2022 Avoiding irrelevant or obscure knowledge or skill areas\n", "7 .

Provide four response choices for each question.\n1 3 . Do not repeat information in each response choice that could be included in the\n      stem.\n1 4 . The response choices should serve either as completions to a statement stem or as\n      short replies to a question stem.\n1 5 . Be sure all response choices are parallel in structure.\n12.

Write the key answer, i.e., the correct answer from the response choices, so that it\n      provides a logical and grammatical completion of a statement stem or a logical and\n      concise answer to a question.\n1 8 . Keep the key similar in length, detail, and grammatical construction to the\n      distractors.\n1 9 . Make the response choices, A, B, C and D, the key answer an approximately equal\n      number of times in a test.\n2 0 . Be sure the sequence of key answers is random.\nDistractors\n2 1 . Keep distractors plausible and able to attract respondents who are not fully\n", "      knowledgeable or skilled.\n2 2 . Use \u201cnone of the above\u201d as a distractor only in items where there is one absolutely\n      correct answer.\n2 3 . Never use \u201call of the above\u201d since it allows a respondent who knows only that two\n      of the choices are correct to choose it.\nSensitivity\n24.

The running rail type is of 115 lbs/yard RE section standard carbon steel.\n             Head hardened or fully heat treated rail having a Brinell hardness number of\n             365 to 380 is installed on both rails of main line curved track having a radius\n             less than 600m (1968.5\u2019). At all other locations, running rail is standard\n             carbon rail.\n5.2.         For those curve section of central radius less than 600m (1968.5\u2019), a\n             restraining rail is installed. The restraining rail is of 100 lbs/yard A.R.A. \u2013\n             Type \u201cA\u201d, horizontally oriented, parallel to the running rails of a track, the\n             head of which is contacted by the back of a wheel flange to hold the wheels in\n             correct alignment and reduce premature wear of the high rail. Restraining rail\n             is typically started on tangent track 3 m (10\u2019) prior to the beginning of a spiral\n             or circular and extend 15 m (49\u2019) beyond the end of a spiral or circular curve.\n             The restraining rail is located at a gap of 50.8 mm (2\u201d) (minimum) to 63.5 mm\n             (2.5\u201d) (maximum) adjacent to the gauge side of the low rail i.e. inside rail.\n             Such gap is also known as flangeway. For flangeway compatibility, the back\n             to back wheel gauge shall be 1 475 mm \u00b1 1.6 mm (4' 10 1/16\" \u00b1 1/16\").\n5.3.         For those curve section of central radius less than 600m (1968.5\u2019), a wayside\n             track lubricator is installed to reduce rail wear and noise. The lubricator is\n             located at the start of a horizontal curve at the point of first full wheel flange \u2013\n             rail contact, whereas the exact contact location is site-specific depending on\n             curve radius, cant deficiency and train speed. Only the gauge side of the high\n             side rail and the contact face of the restraining rail will be lubricated.\n5.4.

Introduction\n1.1.    This Annex defines the interface requirements for the 600VDC side-contact\n                                                     rd\n        third rail traction power supply system (hereafter referred as the 3 rail system)\n        and the train system.\n                                           rd\n1.2.    The physical interface point for the Contract shall be defined as the point of\n        contact between the collector shoe and the 3 rail system contact rail.\n1.3.    In accordance with the interface requirements of PS 31, the Contractor shall,\n        via the Engineer, liaise with the 3 rail system contractor to provide interface\n        specification, design study, delivery schedule, installation, testing and setting\n        to work plan.\n2. General Description of the 3rd rail system\n2.1.    The supply of traction power to the train will be at a nominal voltage of\n        600VDC derived from the 4.16kVAC, 13.8 kVAC or 27.6 kVAC supplies via\n        the Rectifier Transformer and Rectifiers (T-R)  rd units at traction substations.\n        The traction power supply system utilizes 6-pulse or rd12-pulse rectifications\n        with corresponding ripplerd frequencies of 720 Hz. The rectifier output is\n        typically operated at not more than 2 % ripple content. Harmonics of these\n        frequencies would also be present. System voltages are as follows:\n        Nominal direct voltage of the high voltage system         600 VDC\n        Average voltage at collector shoe                 580 VDC\n               rd\n        Minimum voltage at collector shoe                         350 VDC\n        Maximum voltage at collector shoe                         720 VDC\n", "2.2. Currents will be supplied to the train by the 3 rail system and will return to\n     the traction substations via the running rails. The 3 rail system will be\n     connected such that the 3 rail is at positive potential and is mounted on\n     insulators to the outside of and slightly higher than the running rails. The\n     return of the circuit is via the running rails. The current is collected by the\n     train through the collector shoes, attached to the trucks, which slide along the\n     top of the contact rail. Polarity is negative grounded to the running rail and the\n     negative running rail is floating with respect to ground in some areas.\n2.3. The 3 rail system will consist of a number of traction substations such that it\n", "                                             Appendix I Annex 2, page AppI Ann2-3\n                                                           rd\n          forms a continuous system which will supply power to the trains without\n          interruption under normal conditions. The 3 rail system will, however, be\n          divided into a number of electrical sections between the traction substations to\n          meet the operational requirements.\n2.4.      The typical traction gap (refer to Clause 4.3(a) below) distance is 21.03 m (69\n          feet) and the existing contact rail arrangement shall refer to Contract Drawing\n          No. NST 070.\n                                              2\n2.5.      The third rail, a.k.a. contact rail, supplies the 600 VDC traction power to the\n          vehicle via a sliding current collector shoe. The collector shoe rides on the top\n          surface of the contact rail. The contact rail is of 74 kg/m rail section, having a\n                                                                      rd\n          cross-sectional area of 9420 mm . The metallurgical properties      and electrical\n          resistance shall refer to Contract Drawing No. NST 071. The collector shoe\n          shall maintain adequate contact pressure as required rd    to interface with the\n          contact rail under specified conditions and the most adverse combination of\n          all manufacturing and service tolerances, dynamic movements and maximum\n          wear on all related components on both the train and the 3 rail system\n                          rd\n3. Performance Requirements of the 3                              rail system and\n     Train System Interfaces\n3.1.      Supply Voltage\n          The nominal 3 rail system voltage is 600 VDC. All train performance\n          requirements in motoring, except as otherwise stated, shall be met or\n          surpassed at all voltages from 580 VDC and 720 VDC. Between 350 VDC\n          and 580 VDC, the train may operate at reduced performance, by reducing the\n          base speed. This shall maintain the traction line current below the maximum\n          level specified in section 3.4 below.\n3.2.      Supply Transient\n                                         rd\n     (a)  Transient voltages of either polarity in excess of 1.2kV can be expected on the\n          high voltage circuits of the Subway Car due to energy discharge from on\n          board magnetic storage elements at icy third rail conditions. The\n          characterization of the energy available is related to the size and behaviour of\n          the on-board energy storage elements and the equipment. All high voltage\n", "    equipment shall be designed to withstand without damage or degraded\n    performance, the transient voltages that are to be expected from either the on-\n    board equipment or the third rail system.\n(b) Whilst the terms \"nominal 3 rail system voltage\" or \"600 VDC\" are used in\n    this Specification, these shall be construed as intending to describe circuits\n    with design voltage range of 580 VDC and 720 VDC inclusive. All train\n    equipment shall be protected from damage resulting from transient over and\n", "                                           Appendix I Annex 2, page AppI Ann2-4\n         under-voltage conditions which may occur in the actual operating\n         environment or as a result of the train design. The Contractor shall provide\n         suitable transient suppression.\n     (c) The train shall be protected against the transient voltages of either polarity up\n         to 1.2k VDC for 1 milli-second with an energy of approximately 20 joules.\n3.3.     Overcurrent Protection\n         The maximum fault level appearing at any one DC busbar is expected to be\n         2.5kA steady state. Each DC track feeder circuit breakers will be fitted with\n         instantaneous overcurrent trips having a maximum setting of three times of\n         the above steady state current for 150 ms. In view of the fact that severe\n         service interruption will be caused by the operation of the DC track feeder\n         circuit breaker due to an overcurrent fault, the design of the train system shall\n         be capable to clear the overcurrent fault of the train equipment, such as, the\n         traction system (refer to PS 11), without causing superfluous operation the 3rd\n         rail system DC track feeder circuit breaker.\n                         rd\n                            rd\n3.4.     Current Limit\n     (a) The T1 Train peak starting current is limited to 800A for 50 msecs per car i.e.\n         4,800 A per 6 Car train. If the line current exceeded 1 450 A per car, the\n         traction overload protection device will be operated to cut-out the associated\n         car from the 3 rail traction power supply system. In order to avoid nuisance\n         tripping of the 3 rail system DC track feeder breaker, the design of the\n         traction system (refer to PS 11) of the train shall not exceed the current limits\n         of the T1 train.                                                           rd\n     (b) The inrush current shall be limited to be no greater than 150 A/ms per car, or\n         900 A/msec per 6 Car train, under all operating conditions.\n                                                                                          rd\n3.5.     Radio Frequency Interference\n         The Contractor shall ensure that the collector shoe system shall not radiate\n         radio frequency interference (RFl) or cause RFl to be generated by the 3 rail\n         system above the typical level presently emitted by the T1 trains under the\n         same operating conditions.\n", "3.6.   Compatibility Test\n3.6.1. An interface test to confirm the compatibility of the collector shoe with the 3\n       rail system under the worst operating conditions shall be carried out by the\n       Contractor.\n3.6.2. This test shall include a measurement of each individual and the total\n       cumulative arcing times excluding the traction gap (refer to Clause 4.3(a)\n", "                                         Appendix I Annex 2, page AppI Ann2-5\n       below).\n3.6.3. It is a requirement that for each arcing time, it shall be less than 0.1s.\n3.6.4. For the total cumulative arcing time, it shall be less than 1.0% of the total run\n       time.\n4. Design Constraints\n4.1.   Corrosion, Moisture and Snow\n4.2.1. Equipment mounted on the train will be subjected to saline dripping which\n       may include other salts that can be deposited on the collector shoe, for\n       example, lime. In addition, air in tunnels carries a heavy dust content, both\n       induced by the ventilation system and caused by the railway operation. The\n       combination of the above will have an adverse effect on the insulation\n       creepage surfaces and the life of the metal components.\n4.2.2. The general atmosphere contains a high level of industrial pollutants and salt\n       spray.\n4.2.3. Top contact rails are susceptible to ice and snow contamination in cold\n       climates.\n4.2.4. No lubrication of the contact material shall be necessary.\n                                  rd\n4.2.   Collector Shoe Clearance Envelope\n       The collector shoe shall not infringe the Subway Car Equipment Gauge Line\n       as shown in Contract Drawing No. NST 005.\n4.3.   Traction Gap and Collector Shoe Interface\n", "(a)    The continuity of contact rails will be broken at junctions in the track to allow\n       continuity of the running rails. As such, traction gaps exist which may cause\n       momentary loss of power to the train and excessive arcing. A traction gap\n       detection shall be provided to interface with the traction gaps (refer to PS\n       11.6.1(c)(vi)).\n( b ) Inside the carhouse of the AUTHORITY\u2019s Subway System Yards, there will\nno contact\n       rail available from the 3 rail system. For the purpose of ensuring safety of\n       the maintainer, provision shall be made in such a way that when the train is\n       entering the carhouse, as long as the last collector shoe of a train leaves the\n       contact rail and potential as measured by the traction and braking system is\n       below 350VDC, the 600VDC high tension circuit shall be shutdown and all\n       Rail Gap Contactors shall be disconnected immediately, in order to ensure that\n", "                                Appendix I Annex 2, page AppI Ann2-6\nno dangerous residue voltage originating from the car exists in the collector\nshoes and will not put the maintainer at any risk of electrical shock hazard\nwhen standing near the collector shoes.\n", "", "                                                 Appendix I Annex 3, page AppI Ann3-1\nAPPENDIX I DESIGNATED AND INTERFACING CONTRACTS..................... 2\nANNEX 3  ATC INTERFACES........................................................................... 2\n1 .

This Annex defines the interface requirements for the Automatic Train\n       Control (ATC) system which includes both the existing signalling system and\n       the Speed Control System (SCS), and the train systems.\n1.1.2. The Named Suppliers of the existing signalling system (e.g. the trip switch)\n       and the Speed Control System (SCS) who will be called hereafter the ATC\n       Named Supplier, shall be in accordance with Appendix D. The Contractor\n       shall purchase from the Named Supplier all ATC equipment as stipulated in\n       this Annex. Deliverables shall be limited to existing T1 SCS documentation as\n       revised to meet design changes if applicable.\n1.1.3. The baseline interface design of the ATC and train system shall be based on\n       the T1 train. Wherever there is any requirements as specified in this Annex\n       duplicate requirements for a particular criterion of the baseline interface\n       design, the more stringent requirement shall apply. Any conflict in\n       requirements shall be brought to the attention of the Engineer.\n1.1.4. Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall ensure hardware inter-\n       changeability of all SCS equipment between the T1 train and the train.\n1.1.5. The SCS shall provide continuous on-board enforcement of train operating\n       speed limits and shall realize important safety benefits in the subway. The\n       system shall eventually replace the existing signalling system which adopts\n       the current Grade Timing method of speed enforcement and uses timer relays\n       as well as lunar white and flashing red aspects to enforce speed limits.\n1.1.6.

The train will be driven through the plant at 5 km/h (3MPH) on its own power.\n       A mixture of water and acid will be sprayed onto the body and left to stand for\n       a length of time. The mixture is then removed by water and brushes, followed\n       by a final rinse with fresh water. The process may be repeated a few times to\n       achieve the required standard of cleanliness.\n4.2.3. The exterior of the complete carbody between cantrails and solebar will be\n       washed.\n4.2.4. The following chemicals are used for the acid washing of Existing T1 Trains\n       with aluminium bodies:\n            Chemical Ingredients                         Diluted to (% w/w)\n            Oxalic acid                                  7 \u2013 13\n            Linear alcohol ethoxylate /propoxylate       1\u20135\n4.3    Cleaning of Windows\n4.3.1. To prevent the accumulation of water stains, the outside surface of Existing\n       T1 Train windows are cleaned at regular intervals using hand-held power\n       brushes and the proprietary chemical Glass Clear (a water solution containing\n       hydrofluoric acid and silicon dioxide particles).\n4.3.2. The Contractor may submit alternative cleaning methods, or suitable treatment\n       that obviate such cleaning for approval.\n4.4    Heavy Internal Cleaning\n       Heavy internal cleaning will be carried out with the train berthed at a heavy\n       cleaning track. Access to the trains will be provided by platforms at floor level\n       along the full length of the train.

For safety reasons, the sheds of the carhouse are not equipped with the third\n       rail, hence, a supply through a long lead is provided. For third rail systems, the\n       shore supply cables are usually fed from electrified rails suspended from the\n       shed roof. The cables are hung from trolleys running along the rails so that the\n       supply is available along the whole track. The lead is plugged into a socket on\n       the side of the train. One adequately rated Carhouse Receptacles in a form of\n       female plugs for both auxiliary and traction systems, shall be provided to\n       accept the above shore supply (refer to PS 11.6.1(d)).\n6.2.2. Design consideration shall be given to ensure that the auxiliary and traction\n       systems are able to automatically differentiate the operations of traction gap\n       detection (refer to 11.6.1(c)(vi)) and the above receptacles.\n       (No specifications text modifications required.)\n", "                                           Appendix I Annex 5, page AppI Ann5-9\n6.3     Recovery from Derailment and Locked Axle\n6.3.1.  The design of the trains shall aim to utilize the existing recovery equipment\n        with minimum requirement for additional hardware:\n    (a) In the event of a derailment, the derailed car will be restored to the running\n        rails using a set of specialist re-railing equipment which consists of hydraulic\n        jacks, re-railing bridge and roller carriages. The working principles of existing\n        rerailing equipment are shown in Contract Drawing No. NST 014.\n    (b) In the event of a locked axle, a pair of emergency recovery dolly will be fitted\n        to the affected axle by jacking under the truck frame or axle boxes. The design\n        of existing emergency recovery dolly is shown in Contract Drawing No. NST\n        014. The truck frame assembly shall be designed to accept the above\n        emergency recovery dolly. Underframe clearance shall be provided sufficient\n        to allow the car to negotiate, without physical interference, over the minimum\n        radius curve while the recovery dolly is in place at any of the four axle\n        positions.\n6.3.2.  The Contractor shall provide additional equipment, or modifications to\n        existing equipment, for recovery of the trains from derailments and locked\n        axles, as part of the special tools specified in PS 24. As an alternative, the\n        Contractor may provide a suitable rerailing equipment, such as, a wheel skate,\n        as part of the special tools in accordance with PS 24, which can be installed\n        underneath the wheel to meet the above recovery requirements. Four (4)\n        complete set of such equipment shall be provided and no adjustment shall be\n        required when applying it to put a derailed car on the track.\n6.3.3.  All jacking points, including those that will be used for applying the wheel\n        skates described in Clause 6.3.1(b) above, shall be painted with the alternate\n        yellow and black stripes pattern. Same positions of jacking points of the T1\n        train according to Contract Drawings No. NST 007 and NST 041 shall be\n        adopted. For an efficient emergency operation, free access to all jacking\n        points shall be provided without the need of dismantling any equipment from\n        the car.

General\n1.1     Equipment and components expected to be removed from the Subway Car for\n        repair, maintenance, servicing or overhaul shall require unique identification.\n        A serial number, description and stock code along with bar coding where\n        possible is required. AUTHORITY\u2019s maintenance philosophy requires strict\n        adherence to serialised parts tracking and computerised record keeping so that\n        a complete component history is always up to date and available. Serial\n        exchanges of components along with original installations for the first time or\n        subsequent times along with other attributes requires documenting on\n        AUTHORITY Work Orders for central processing into a computerised Work\n        Order System. Upon request, the interfaces between AUTHORITY\n        computerised Work Orders System and Contractor\u2019s Maintenance, Repair and\n        Overall database may be developed to allow for electronically data exchange.\n        The Contractor shall provide submit the development proposal for approval.\n2.      Equipment Label\n2.1     Essentially a fixed plate is attached to major equipment, an appropriate label\n        for other equipment that supports permanent adhesion and or etching or other\n        methods can be used on cast components. The method of serialisation along\n        with the data content shall be submitted for approval during SEMP 2 to SEMP\n        3. AUTHORITY will provide, at Notice To Proceed (NTP), a list of common\n        plates and labels currently used to assist with labelling requirements.\n2.2     For purposes of clarity a T1 serialisation \u201cBlue Book\u201d will be provided to the\n        car-builder, at NTP, to demonstrate our expectations. A new \u201cBlue Book\u201d for\n        NST cars shall need to be produced and delivered in electronic format by the\n        car-builder, incrementally once sub-systems, system product SEMP 3 are\n        completed.\n", "2.3     Prior to delivery of each product or Subway Car, the serialised configuration\n        of each car must be provided in electronic format and paper format (electronic\n        format to be supplied by AUTHORITY, at NTP) and approved and signed off\n        by AUTHORITY\u2019s on-site inspector before shipment from the car-builder.\n        Approval to ship the car will not be granted until this is signed off.\n2.4     After delivery of each Subway Car to AUTHORITY property the record\nkeeping\n        activity of serialised components must be maintained using AUTHORITY\n        Work Orders\n", "                                                              Appendix J, page AppJ-3\n           and by electronically exchanging Work Order data to and from Contractor\n           database.\n2.5        Any warranty exchange for a serialised component must also be recorded in\n           AUTHORITY\u2019s Work Order system and by electronically exchanging Work\n           Order data to and from Contractor database.\n2.6        Once the a serialized product or a vehicle is delivered to AUTHORITY\nproperty any\n           work performed on a Subway Car or its components must be carried out using\n           a AUTHORITY Work Order and by electronically exchanging Work Order\n           data to and from Contractor database. Carrying out work without a Work\n           Order goes against AUTHORITY policy and standard operating procedure. If\n           required a work station will be provided to the Contractors onsite support\n           personnel in order to efficiently process Work Order information. Upon the\n           request of the Contractor, AUTHORITY may provide training in this area to a\n           limited number of onsite car-builder personnel. Sub-vendors shall need to\n           perform work through the Contractor and or AUTHORITY personnel. All\n           work order processing and data entry is to be performed by AUTHORITY\n           and or trained Contractor personnel only. Controls of this nature are very\n           strict due to the use of restrictive status codes where processes are required to\n           release cars for use on the mainline or yard areas. The car-builder shall\n           therefore be required to manage all sub-vendors activities in this regard.\n3.         Serial Number Allocation\n3.1        Since the serial number and component description act together as a unique\n           identifier, it is preferable to keep the serial number a relatively short number.\n           The serial may contain leading or trailing letters. Contractor and Supplier\n           defined serialization program shall be submitted to AUTHORITY for\n           information\n3.2        Where an interchangeable component type is delivered with the NST vehicles\n           that can be used on previous AUTHORITY type vehicles the rules of existing\n           serialisation for numbers and identification must be maintained to avoid\n           duplication. AUTHORITY will submit at NTP a list of existing\n           AUTHORITY serialized component that includes Manufacture part number,\n", "      AUTHORITY stock Code and AUTHORITY short description.\n3.3   Components that shall be serialized shall fall in one of the following\n      categories:\n3.3.1 Assemblies for which a First Article Inspection is required, except for exterior\n      and interior lighting, floor heaters, and passenger seats.\n3.3.2 All circuit card assemblies, where space permit.\n3.3.3 Suppliers serialized components.\n", "                                                        Appendix J, page AppJ-4\n3.4    Any serialized components that are commercially available shall not be bar-\n       coded in compliance with this Appendix requirement. Supplier bar code shall\n       be used and it shall be to the discretion of AUTHORITY to include these\n       items in the car builder serialization package.\n3.5    The number of serialized component, per car, shall not exceed 400 unique line\n       of data entry.\n4.     Serialised Component Description\n4.1    Each component group or type requires a unique descriptive identifier (up to\n       15 characters) in addition to a serial number. The format of each description\n       generally follows a common theme where short forms or simple acronyms are\n       put together to create this description. An example of a NST traction motor\n       could be \u201cMotorTMNST\u201d where \u201cMotor\u201d is a common description, \u201cTM\u201d is\n       the subsystem identifier and \u201cNST\u201d is of course the vehicle type. The \u201cBlue\n       book\u201d is a good example to follow. AUTHORITY will submit to the\n       Contractor T1 Blue book at NPT.\n5.     Serialised Component Hierarchy\n5.1    The structure of serialised components can sometimes be multi-leveled.\nAUTHORITY\n       makes use of the structure by each component having a next higher assembly\n       (NHA). In some cases this NHA is the vehicle itself, in others is can be an\n       assembly where it could have sub-assemblies. It is cases like this where an\n       assembly that has sub-assemblies can be exchanged that AUTHORITY has\n       created this NHA relationship. This structure is sometimes referred to as\n       parent and child relationship. AUTHORITY\u2019s Work Order system makes\n       efficient use of this NHA identifier and automatically maintains the\n       configuration of any sub-assemblies during its exchange. Each component\n       must have at least one NHA identifier. As an example the \u201cMotorTMNST\u201d\n       could have either \u201cTruck1NST\u201d or \u201cTruck2NST\u201d. This way when a truck is\n       exchanged the axle sets, gearboxes, brake cylinders and any other truck\n       mounted equipment are still attached to the truck and configuration is\n       maintained.\n", "6.    Stock Code\n6.1   The Stock code is a AUTHORITY supplied stock code based on vendor supply\ndata,\n      cross referenced through Material Systems information. Each component\n      (serialised or not) should have a AUTHORITY assigned stock code. From the\n      drawing approval cycle of SEMP 2 and SEMP 3, AUTHORITY will assign\n      Stock Code Number and Description to allow the Car-builder to assign a\n      specific one to each component.

An electronic summary of all stock codes\n         referencing all manufacturing ordering information shall be required prior to\n         the first Subway Car delivery.\n7.       Bar Code\n7.1      A bar code shall be part of the serial plate and or label where possible. This\n         bar code shall be made up of the serial, description and stock code so that a\n         reference table can be utilised with scanning methods to automatically return\n         all appropriate component information. This electronic file format will be\n         provided by AUTHORITY at SEMP 1, and is to be delivered by the\n         Contractor prior to the delivery of the first Subway Car. The Bar code\n         requirement is primarily for AUTHORITY\u2019s in-house Materials system. Shall\n         the Contractor or its Supplier already has a bar coding process in place, it is\n         acceptable to have two bar code installed.\n8.

Sub-System Event data coding, Type and Format\n10.1    The contractor shall ensue that all sub-systems protocol shall follow the data\n        coding requirements, such as the 4 character coding structure, as described in\n        this Appendix and compatible with the TIMS particularly the Event Recorder\n        as specified in PS 10.\n10.2    All events from the vehicle sub-systems which shall be transmitted by TIMS,\n        either through the Radio as critical real-time events or through the Yard\n        YMSS equipment as maintenance events. In either case the four (4) character\n        event code shall have a specific meaning which shall be compatible with the\n        AUTHORITY\u2019s Work Order system in order to disseminate the information\n        of the events by means of a tree-structure. This shall enable printing\\sorting\n        event data by sub-system, function and or by specific event. It is a\n        requirement that all event data regardless of which format as detailed in this\n        Appendix, a unique 4 char code shall be provided with a break down\n        structure in accordance with, but not limited to, the following rules.\n    (a) The first character shall be a sub-system character where\n", "( i )   b=Brake System\n( i i )   a=Air Compressor System\n( i i i )   s=Static Converter\n( i v )    d=Doors\n( v )    p=Propulsion\n( v i )    c=cab and or passenger device (PAA or Emerg)\n( v i i )    m=Monitoring System\n( v i i i )   z=Speed Control System\n", "                                                               Appendix J, page AppJ-7\n    (b)      The second where possible shall be a breakdown by function\n    ( i )   Contactors\n    ( i i )    Sensors\n    ( i i i )    Overload\n    ( i v )     Armature Control\n    ( v )    Specific equipment identifier\n    (c)      The third or fourth characters shall be used as alphanumeric characters to\n             describe the event with acronyms to have meaning that is readable where\n             possible.

Hence, for consistency purpose, it is a requirement\n             that when importing an event, it shall be compatible with the AUTHORITY\u2019s\n             existing Work Order System according to the specified format(s).\n10.4         When importing an event, the following requirements of the existing\nAUTHORITY\u2019s\n             work order system shall be met:\n    (a)     Inside the event file, only ASCI characters from CHR(32) inclusive to\n             CHR(255) shall be provided and accepted by the existing AUTHORITY\u2019s\n             work order system.\n    (b)     Each Event shall be sequentially stored and delimited by a \u201c*\u201d ASCI CHR(48).\n    (c)      Inside each event, the following Format(s) shall be allowed:\n    (i)      It is the content that when interpreted by the AUTHORITY work order system,\n    shall be\n             discrete the event differently based on distinctive content.\n", "    (ii)      When the AUTHORITY W.O. system has finished importing the event data\n    file, it shall\n              erase the file as delivered by the YMSS.\n10.5          Each event shall be presented in the following three formats as stored in the\n

Background\n3.1       The backup battery sets on the subway, streetcar and SRT vehicle fleets\n          require preventative maintenance and testing on a regular basis. This testing\n          requirement is based on a current fleet size of 600 battery sets. That is 350 sets\n          from subway/SRT vehicles and 250 sets from streetcars plus the battery sets\n          (refer to PS 17.4.2) from the train (also known as the New Subway Train in\n          this Appendix).\n", "3.2 It is a requirement that, based on a 5 year cycle, one 8 hour shift per day and a\n    5 day work week, the existing productivity of processing of a battery set on\n    every 2 days shall be maintained by using the Charger.\n", "                                                     Appendix K, page AppK-3\n14. Definitions\n4.1 Battery Cell Block \u2013 In certain battery sets the cells come in 2 cell or 3 cell\n    packages called Blocks.\n4.2 Battery Set \u2013 A specific number of cell blocks connected together to get the\n    proper terminal voltage for the vehicle type. For example, an H6 battery set\n    has two 3 cell blocks and ten 2 cell blocks for a total of 26 cells.\n4.3 Test Stub \u2013 The software subroutine that controls a specific function of the\n    whole battery set test. For example the subroutine that governs the discharge\n    process.\n4.4 Charge Rates - The current that a Charger supplies to the battery is normally\n    expressed as a fraction of the theoretical current (for a given battery) needed\n    to charge the battery completely in 1 hour. This theoretical current is called\n    the nominal battery capacity rating and is represented as \u201cC.\u201d For example, a\n    current of 0.1 C is that current which, in 10 hours, theoretically, would\n    recharge the battery fully. The required charging rates for various styles of\n    recharging shall refer to the battery manufacturer\u2019s manual.\n4.5 Thermal Runaway - If the constant current is applied past the point when the\n    battery reaches approximately 85% of its fully charged state, the excess heat\n    will cause \u201cthermal runaway\u201d to occur. Under thermal runaway conditions,\n    the excess heat in the battery will cause its voltage to drop. The drop in\n    voltage will cause the charge rate to increase, generating more heat and\n    accelerating the cycle. The temperature and internal pressure of the battery\n    will continue to rise until permanent damage results.\n4.6 Operator - The qualified battery maintenance personnel of the AUTHORITY.\n15. Scope of Work\n", "5.1   The scope of work shall comprise, unless specifically excluded, the design,\n      manufacture, supply, delivery, installation, testing, commissioning and\n      rectification of defects during the 2 Years Warranty Period for the Charger\n      and the associated equipment necessary to facilitate operation and\n      maintenance of the battery sets which include special tools and testing\n      equipment, spare parts and Operation and Maintenance Manuals and training,\n      as specified in this Appendix.\n5.2   The Charger shall be able to perform the following duties:\n5.2.1 Normal duty: charging and testing two (2) battery sets simultaneously;\n5.2.2 Peak duty: simultaneously testing and conditioning an additional two (2)\n      battery sets; and\n", "                                                     Appendix K, page AppK-4\n5.2.3 Conditional duty: charging, testing and capacity recovering an individual\n      battery cell or one Battery Cell Block; or\n5.2.4 Future duty: being expandable to simultaneously testing and conditioning up\n      to eight (8) battery sets in the future.\n5.3   The Charger shall be a service proven, automatic, computer-controlled,\n      switching power electronic featured and self-contained.\n16.

This shall allow the operator to have an up to date assessment\n", "                                                        Appendix K, page AppK-7\n      of the battery condition so that any deterioration in cell performance can be\n      automatically detected and appropriate maintenance actions can be planned.\n7.3.3 Cell Balancing Functions. In a battery set, small differences between cells due\n      to production tolerances or operating conditions tend to be magnified with\n      each charge / discharge cycle. Hence, weaker cells become overstressed\n      during charging causing them to become even weaker, until they eventually\n      fail causing premature failure of the battery. The Charger shall be able to\n      provide battery cell balancing functions in oder to compensate the weaker\n      cells by equalising the charge on all the cells in the battery set and thus\n      extending battery life.\n7.3.4 History Function. The Charger shall be able to provide monitoring and storing\n      functions of the battery's history in order to estimate the SOH of the battery\n      set.

The discharge function shall\n        include two modes of operation:\n7.6.1   Equalization Mode\n    (a) When a battery set is to be tested and the state of charge is unknown, the\n        Charger shall be able to allow the battery set to be discharged until the voltage\n        across all cell falls to 1.0 Volt.\n    (b) And each cell shall not be allowed to discharge any further and shall be\n        maintained at 1+/- 0.05 Volt until all other cells have reached that threshold.\n    (c) If a cell has an unexpected reaction and drops below 0.9 volts it is to be\n        switched out of the circuit and the software shall indicate this state to the\n        operator.\n    (d) When voltage across all of the cells has fallen to 1 Volt and the equalization\n        process is complete, the initial voltage, final voltage and time to discharge for\n        each cell shall be recorded in the history file as part of the history function.\n7.6.2   Capacity Check Discharge Mode\n    (a) Capacity Testing. According to the battery manufacturer\u2019s recommendation,\n        the Charger shall be able to program and carry out the constant-load test in\n        order to determine the capacity of a battery. This test shall be conducted by\n        connecting a predetermined load to the battery and then recording the amount\n        of time needed to discharge the battery to a predetermined level.\n    (b) Assuming 100% receptivity, the Charger shall be able to recycle the battery\n        discharging energy back feeding to the AC line. The recycled voltage\n        distortion shall not be exceeded the 5% limit as set out in the IEEE Std 519-\n        1992 \u201cIEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control\n        in Electrical Power Chargers\u201d.

This\n    report shall be viewed on screen, exported to a database file or printed to\n    hardcopy, in such a way that it shall indicate the individual cell capacity and\n    the resultant battery set capacity. Any cells that are below 75% capacity shall\n    be flagged and announced to the operator via a graphical interface. Constant\n    feedback of the test results shall be available to the operator in realtime.\n", "                                                           Appendix K, page AppK-9\n    (d) For those measured capacity of the battery set which is less than 80% of the\n        rated capacity, the battery set shall be flagged as service required.\n7.7     The Charger shall provide the charge function. The charge function shall\n        include two modes of operation:\n7.7.1   Service Charge Mode\n    (a) The battery set shall be charged using a constant current charging method\n        until the voltage across all cells reaches the manufacturer\u2019s specification for\n        that battery set type. The target voltage shall be configurable for future\n        expansion. No single point failure of the Charger shall any cell be allowed to\n        surpass the target voltage.\n    (b) As each cell reaches its full charge it shall be switched out of the charge\n        circuit but remain monitored until all cells have reached the proper voltage.\n        The Charger shall adjust the charge currents appropriately to maintain the\n        manufacturer recommended charge rate on the remaining cells. If any cell\n        voltage starts to decrease after it is switched out it shall be switched back in\n        and brought back to the target voltage. The software shall record the time it\n        took for the cell to initially reach the target voltage and record it in the history\n        file and display it to the operator via the interface. When all cells reach their\n        target voltage the battery set is fully charged and ready for duty. The software\n        shall announce to the operator any cells that have a large variance in charge\n        time from the rest of the set.\n7.7.2   Capacity Check Overcharging Mode\n    (a) It is a requirement that in order to check the capacity of a battery set, it shall\n        first be equalized and then overcharged. The battery set shall be charged at a\n        rate corresponding to manufacturer specifications for overcharge. At the end\n        of the appropriate charge time, any cell which has a voltage 20% lower than\n        the target voltage shall be flagged and logged as a faulty cell. The charging\n        cycle shall be considered as completed when all cells are at the proper\n        terminal voltage.\n    (b) When the battery cells are disconnected from the battery set/block, the\n", "        Charger shall be able to charge all cells individually or isolate faulty cells to\n        ensure one faulty cell does not stop the whole charge process.\n7.7.3   The Charger shall be able to provide the following functions:\n    (a) Optimising the charging rate (a.k.a. Stabilising)\n    (b) Knowing when to stop (i.e. Terminating)\n", "                                                     Appendix K, page AppK-10\n18.   Software Requirements\n8.1   Software requirements as specified in PS 29 shall be complied with.\n8.2   It is a requirement that the Charger shall be fully automated by software and\n      take a minimum of skill to operate. The order or combination of software test\n      processes shall be configurable by a technical maintenance staff (who is not\n      the operator). Specifically maintenance staff, with password access, shall be\n      able to recombine existing stubs to create new stubs such as conditioning,\n      charging, discharging, service charging, etc, as well as the ability to define\n      (within reasonable limits) voltage and time parameters. This new test\n      sequence can then be saved and then will be selectable on the top menu by the\n      technical maintenance staff.\n8.3   The Charger shall have a default flagging charge capacity of 80 %, which\n      shall be operator settable to other percentage values.\n8.4   The test data shall be related to a serial number and a work order number\n      (refer to Appendix J) that is entered by the operator along with their employee\n      badge number. The Charger shall track the work orders on battery sets by\n      serial number and date. Historical data shall be stored in an industry standard\n      database that is exportable and readable by existing AUTHORITY database\n      programs.
